|6|6.py|String concatination|Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.||Easy|
|7|7.py|`%` modulo to find remainder and conditions|Write a Python program to print "YES" if the user input number is even, else print "NO"|`n%2==0` for even number|Easy|
|8|8.py|Functions|Write a Python program to convert the given string into a morse code.|Morse code from internet|Easy|
|9|9.py|Array|Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.|Values should be < or = k|Easy|
|10|10.py|Array|Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.||Easy|
|11|11.py|Array|Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.||Easy|
|12|12.py|Stack|Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).|Use stack|Easy|
|13|13.py|String|You are given the firstname and lastname of a person on two different lines. Your task is to read them and print the following:`Hello firstname lastname! You just delved into python.`|String concatination|Easy|
|14|14.py|Functions and array|A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return False.|Iteration|Easy|
|15|15.py|Dictionary|A classroom consists of N students, whose friendships can be represented in an adjacency list.Each student can be placed in a friend group, which can be defined as the transitive closure of that student's friendship relations. In other words, this is the smallest set such that no student in the group has any friends outside this group.|List merge|Easy|
|16|16.py|Stack|On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in three colors: red, green, and blue. One power of the Qux is that if two of them are standing next to each other, they can transform into a single creature of the third color.Given N Quxes standing in a line, determine the smallest number of them remaining after any possible sequence of such transformations.|Use `stack.pop()`|Easy|
|17|17.py|Array|A girl is walking along an apple orchard with a bag in each hand. She likes to pick apples from each tree as she goes along, but is meticulous about not putting different kinds of apples in the same bag.Given an input describing the types of apples she will pass on her path, in order, determine the length of the longest portion of her path that consists of just two types of apple trees.||Easy|
|18|18.py|Sorting and `lambda`|Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.|Use `key = lambda` for sorting.|Easy|
|19|19.py|Conditions|Write a Python program for a rock-paper-scissors game.|Assign values like ROCK = 0; PAPER = 1; SCISSORS = -1.|Easy|

|21|21.py|Next Bigger using `str()`|Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits.||Easy|
|22|22.py|Least Larger|Given an array of numbers and an index, return the index of the least number larger than the element at the given index, or -1 if there is no such index ( or, where applicable, Nothing or a similarly empty value ).||Easy|
|23|23.py|Basic Sequence Practice|Complete the function that takes an integer n and returns a list/array of length abs(n) + 1 of the arithmetic series explained above. Whenn < 0 return the sequence with negative terms.||Easy|
|24|24.py|Reverser|Impliment the reverse function, which takes in input n and reverses it. For instance, reverse(123) should return 321. You should do this without converting the inputted number into a string.||Easy|
|25|25.py|Simple string expansion|Given a string, return the expansion of that string.||Easy|
|26|26.py|Ordered Weights|"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99".||Easy|
|27|27.py|`%` and `//`|A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x âˆ’ 2y is divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible or not by 7 is obtained; you can stop when this number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.||Easy|
